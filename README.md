# vehicleCANSimulator
This code is for a table display at Senior Design Day. An arduino will be placed in a case, connected to a mode button and a potentiometer that changes the input RPM for the system. This will allow for interaction of the vehicle to demonstrate the functionality of the Variable Intake Optimization System (VIOS).
